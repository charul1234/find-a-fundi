Queries:-

1. If Seeker added extra working hours to the Fundi and Fundi has been already booked for that time then how we will manage this condition.
2. If Fundi do not set their hourly charges then can we show the default charge to seeker for the Fundi? 
3. When Fundi complete his job, send confirmation to Seeker and Seeker will reject the confirmation then what will be the next process?
4. If Seeker wants to book Fundi for more than one day:-
	- then will Seeker book for alternate days as per selected timezone per day?
	- Will Seeker book for continuous days without time selection?
	- Will there be a dafault setting of start time and end time if Seeker book for as per day?

5. Is there any condition for package as per service type for Fundi i.e. one can select the packages who have select Package service type.
